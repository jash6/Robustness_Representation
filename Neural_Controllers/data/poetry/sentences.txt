Good morning! How are you?
Hi there! Long time no see.
What’s new with you?
Nice to meet you!
Take care, see you soon.
Goodbye, have a great day!
Talk to you later!
Catch you tomorrow!
Have a safe trip!
Good night, sleep well.
How’s the weather where you are?
Did you watch the game last night?
Busy day today, huh?
The weekend went by so fast!
I can't believe it’s almost November!
Any fun plans for the weekend?
I love your new haircut!
It’s been so hot lately!
How was your vacation?
The traffic today was brutal!
Could you pass me the salt?
Do you know what time it is?
Can you help me with this?
Excuse me, where’s the restroom?
What’s your Wi-Fi password?
How do I get to the nearest subway?
Can I get the check, please?
Do you have this in a smaller size?
When is the next meeting?
What would you recommend from the menu?
I’ll take this one, please.
How much does this cost?
Is there a discount on this item?
I’m just browsing, thanks.
Do you accept credit cards?
Can I try this on?
Can we get a table for two?
I’d like the steak, medium-rare.
This coffee tastes amazing!
Can I have the receipt, please?
You’re doing a great job!
This looks fantastic!
I appreciate your help!
Thank you so much!
You’ve been so kind.
That was delicious!
I love what you’re wearing.
You have such a great sense of humor.
Thanks for the recommendation!
I really enjoyed our conversation.
I’m so sorry for the delay.
Excuse me, can I interrupt?
My apologies, I didn’t mean to offend you.
I’m running late, sorry!
Oops, my bad!
Please, go ahead.
No worries, take your time.
Sorry, I didn’t catch that.
Would you mind repeating that?
Thanks for your patience!
I totally agree with you.
That makes a lot of sense.
You’re absolutely right!
I see your point, but I disagree.
I’m not so sure about that.
That’s a fair point.
Exactly, that’s what I was thinking!
I think we have different opinions on that.
Good point! I hadn’t thought of that.
It’s fine, we can agree to disagree.
How about we grab some lunch?
Let me know if you need anything.
I can give you a hand with that.
Why don’t we try the new restaurant?
Would you like some coffee?
Feel free to ask any questions.
Let’s meet around 3 PM.
You could try restarting the device.
Maybe we should leave early to avoid traffic.
Can I get you anything else?
I’m really excited about this!
I’m feeling a bit under the weather.
That movie was hilarious!
I’m so proud of you!
I’m a little nervous about the interview.
I can’t believe this is happening!
I feel so lucky to have you.
That was really frustrating!
I’m so happy for you!
That must have been tough.
Let’s meet at the cafe around noon.
I’ll call you when I get there.
Are we still on for tomorrow?
Let me check my calendar.
I’ll text you the address.
We should catch up soon!
See you at the usual spot.
Don’t forget our appointment.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.
Let’s reschedule for next week.
