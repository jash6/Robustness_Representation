Cameron Jerrell Newton (born May 11, 1989) is an American football quarterback for the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League (NFL).
Nicknamed "Super Cam", he is the NFL career leader in quarterback rushing touchdowns.
Newton had college football stints at Florida and Blinn before joining Auburn, where he won the Heisman Trophy and 2011 BCS National Championship Game as a junior.
He was selected first overall by the Panthers in the 2011 NFL Draft..
Newton made an impact in his first season, where he set the rookie records for passing and rushing yards by a quarterback, winning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in the process.
The league's first rookie quarterback to throw for 4,000 yards in a season and the first to throw for 400 yards in his NFL debut, he also set the season record for quarterback rushing touchdowns.
Between 2013 and 2017, Newton led the Panthers to three division titles and four playoff appearances.
His most successful season came in 2015 when he was named Most Valuable Player (MVP) and helped Carolina obtain a franchise-best 15–1 record en route to a Super Bowl appearance in Super Bowl 50.
He is one of four African-American quarterbacks to win NFL MVP and was the first to solely receive it..
Following his MVP campaign, Newton struggled with injuries as the Panthers made the playoffs only once in their subsequent four seasons.
After missing the majority of the 2019 season due to surgery, he was released by Carolina and played the 2020 season with the New England Patriots.
He was released by the Patriots in 2021 and returned to the Panthers midway through the season..
Early life and education .
Newton was born in Atlanta on May 11, 1989.
He is the son of Jackie and Cecil Newton Sr., who was a safety for the 1983 Dallas Cowboys and 1984 Buffalo Bills, and the younger brother of Cecil Newton, a center who played for the Jacksonville Jaguars.
His youngest brother, Caylin, was the quarterback for the Howard Bison in the mid-2010s..
Newton was a talented baseball and basketball player as a youth but developed a fear of being hit by a pitch in baseball and could not avoid foul trouble on the basketball court.
He stopped playing baseball at 14 years old and quit basketball shortly into his high school career.
In 2015, Newton graduated from Auburn University with a degree in sociology..
Newton attended Westlake High School in Atlanta, playing for their high school football team.
As a 16-year-old junior, he passed for 2,500 yards and 23 touchdowns and ran for 638 yards and nine touchdowns, gaining the attention of major college programs.
In his senior year, Newton was rated a five-star prospect by Rivals.com, the No.
2 dual-threat quarterback in the nation, and the 14th quarterback and 28th player overall.
He received scholarship offers from Florida, Georgia, Maryland, Ole Miss, Mississippi State, Oklahoma, and Virginia Tech.
He committed to the University of Florida at the beginning of his senior year, becoming part of the top-rated recruiting class in the country for 2007..
Newton initially attended the University of Florida, where he was a member of the Florida Gators football team in 2007 and 2008.
As a freshman in 2007, Newton beat out fellow freshman quarterback John Brantley as the back-up for eventual Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow.
He played in five games, passing for 40 yards on 5-of-10 and rushing 16 times for 103 yards and three touchdowns.
In 2008, during his sophomore season, Newton played in the season opener against Hawaii but suffered an ankle injury and took a medical redshirt season..
On November 21, 2008, Newton was arrested on felony charges of burglary, larceny, and obstruction of justice on an accusation that he stole a laptop computer from another University of Florida student.
He was subsequently suspended from the team.
Campus police "tracked the stolen laptop to the athlete...Newton tossed the computer out his dorm window in a humorously ill-advised attempt to hide it from cops." All charges against Newton were dropped after he completed a court-approved pre-trial diversion program.
"I believe that a person should not be thought of as a bad person because of some senseless mistake that they made," said Newton in 2010.
"I think every person should have a second chance.
If they blow that second chance, so be it for them." Newton announced his intention to transfer from Florida three days before the Gators' national championship win over Oklahoma.
In November 2010, Thayer Evans of Fox Sports reported that Newton faced potential expulsion from the University of Florida for three instances of academic dishonesty, prior to transferring..
In January 2009, Newton transferred to Blinn College in Brenham, Texas, to play for head coach Brad Franchione, son of Dennis Franchione.
That fall, he led his team to the 2009 NJCAA National Football Championship, throwing for 2,833 yards with 22 touchdowns and rushing for 655 yards.
He was named a Juco All-America honorable mention and was the most recruited Juco quarterback in the country.
Newton was ranked as the number one quarterback from either high school or junior college by Rivals.com and was the only five-star recruit.
During Newton's recruitment, Oklahoma, Mississippi State and Auburn were his three finalists.
He eventually signed with the Auburn Tigers..
Newton started the first game of Auburn University's 2010 season, a home win over Arkansas State on September 4, 2010.
Newton accounted for 186 passing yards, 171 rushing yards, and  five total offensive touchdowns.
He was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week following his performance in the 52–26 victory.
Three weeks later, Newton had a second break-out game with 158 passing yards, 176 rushing yards, and five total touchdowns against the South Carolina Gamecocks in the 35–27 victory.
On October 2, Newton led Auburn to a 52–3 victory over Louisiana-Monroe.
He completed three touchdown passes, one of which went for 94 yards to Emory Blake.
It was the longest touchdown pass and offensive play in Auburn football history.

He passed for 210 yards and rushed for 198 yards including four rushing touchdowns.
On October 16, during the Arkansas game, Newton ran for 188 rushing yards and three rushing touchdowns and threw one touchdown pass in the 65–43 victory.
Following these performances, media reports began to list Newton among the top five candidates to watch for the Heisman Trophy..
On October 23, Newton led Auburn to a 24–17 victory over the LSU Tigers.
He rushed for 217 yards in the game, giving him 1,077 yards for the season, and set the SEC record for yards rushing in a season by a quarterback—a record previously held by Auburn quarterback Jimmy Sidle that had stood for over 40 years.
After this game, Newton became just the second quarterback to rush for over 1,000 yards in the conference's history.
He also broke Pat Sullivan's school record for most touchdowns in a single season, a record that had stood since 1971, with 27.
Both of these records were broken on the same play: a 49-yard touchdown run in which Newton escaped two tackles, corrected himself with his arm, eluded two additional tackles, and dragged a defender into the endzone for the touchdown.
The play was described as Newton's "Heisman moment".
Auburn received its first No.
1 overall BCS ranking, and Newton was listed as the overall favorite for the Heisman..
By halftime of the game against rival Georgia, Newton became the first SEC player to ever throw for 2,000 yards and rush for 1,000 yards in a single season.
With the 49–31 victory, Auburn extended its winning streak to 11–0 and clinched the SEC West, allowing them to play in the SEC Championship game.
Newton led Auburn to a 28–27 victory over Alabama in the Iron Bowl after being down 24–0.
The 24-point come-from-behind victory was the largest in the program's 117-year history.
He passed for 216 yards with three passing touchdowns and ran for another..
On December 4, 2010, Newton led the Tigers to an SEC Championship, their first since 2004, by defeating South Carolina 56–17, setting an SEC Championship Game record for most points scored and largest margin of victory.
Newton was named the game MVP after scoring a career-best six total touchdowns, which were four passing and two rushing.
With his performance, Newton also became the third player in NCAA FBS history to throw and run for 20-plus touchdowns in a single season joining former Florida teammate Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick, who reached the milestone earlier the same day.
Newton was named the 2010 SEC Offensive Player of the Year as well as the 2010 AP Player of the Year.
He was also one of four finalists for the 2010 Heisman Trophy, which he won in a landslide victory.
Newton is the third Auburn player to win the Heisman Trophy (along with Pat Sullivan and Bo Jackson)..
Following the victory in the SEC Championship, Auburn was invited to participate in the school's first BCS National Championship Game.
The game took place on January 10, 2011, in Glendale, Arizona, with Auburn playing against the Oregon Ducks.
In a game that Steve Spurrier predicted to score as high as 60–55, Auburn beat Oregon just 22–19 to win the BCS National Championship.
Newton threw for 262 yards, two touchdowns, and one interception.
He rushed 22 times for 65 yards, though he lost a fumble that later allowed Oregon to tie the game with limited time remaining.
Once Auburn received the ball, Newton drove the Tigers down the field to win the game on Wes Byrum's last-second field goal.
Media outlets wrote Newton was upstaged by teammate Michael Dyer, the game's Offensive MVP, and Auburn's defense, which held the high-powered Oregon ground game to just 75 yards On January 13, three days after winning the BCS National Championship, Newton declared for the 2011 NFL Draft, forgoing his senior season..
Newton spent much of the second half of the 2010 football season embroiled in a controversy regarding allegations that his father, Cecil Newton, had sought substantial sums of money in return for his son playing for a major college football team, in violation of National Collegiate Athletic Association rules.
In early November 2010, several Mississippi State University athletic boosters reported to the media that, during their recruitment of his son out of Blinn College nearly a year earlier, Cecil Newton said that it would take "more than just a scholarship" to secure his son's services.
This demand was communicated by booster and former Mississippi State football player Kenny Rogers to fellow boosters and former teammates Bill Bell and John Bond.
Rogers said in a Dallas radio interview that Cecil Newton said it would take "anywhere between $100,000 and $180,000" to get his son to transfer to Mississippi State.
Auburn maintained throughout the investigation, which had begun several months before the public was made aware of it, that they were not involved in any pay-for-play scheme and that Cam Newton was fully eligible to play..
On November 30, Auburn declared Cam Newton ineligible after the NCAA found evidence that Cecil Newton solicited Mississippi State $120,000 to $180,000 in exchange for Cam Newton's athletic service, a violation of amateurism.
Auburn immediately filed to have him reinstated on the basis that Kenny Rogers could not be considered an agent and that Cam Newton was not aware of his father's illegal activity.
The NCAA almost immediately sided with Auburn and reinstated Newton the next day on December 1, declaring him eligible for the 2010 SEC Championship Game three days later, stating that there was not sufficient evidence that Cam Newton or anyone from Auburn had any knowledge of Cecil Newton's actions.
Auburn subsequently limited the access Cecil Newton had to the program as result of NCAA findings.
Also, due to increased pressure by the media and the NCAA investigation, Cecil Newton announced he would not attend the Heisman Trophy Ceremony.
The NCAA reinstatement did not clear Cecil Newton of any wrongdoing; it did, however, establish Cam Newton's eligibility as a candidate for the Heisman Trophy, which he won in a landslide victory with 2,263 points and 729 first-place votes..
In October 2011, the NCAA officially closed its 13-month investigation into the recruitment of Cam Newton, unable to substantiate any allegation or speculation of illicit recruiting by Auburn, and concluded that Cecil Newton only solicited a cash payment from Mississippi State and no other institution attempting to recruit his son.
The investigation, which consisted of over 50 interviews and the reviewing of numerous bank records, IRS documents, telephone records, and e-mail messages, resulted in no findings that would indicate Auburn participated in any pay-for-play scenario in signing Cam Newton.
The NCAA said that the allegations failed to "meet a burden of proof, which is a higher standard than rampant public speculation online and in the media" and that the allegations were not "based on credible and persuasive information".
The NCAA's Stacey Osburn said "We've done all we can do.
We've done all the interviews.
We've looked into everything and there's nothing there.
Unless something new comes to light that's credible and we need to look at, it's concluded.".

Before the draft, Panthers owner Jerry Richardson asked Newton to maintain his clean-cut appearance after Newton told Richardson he had no tattoos or piercings and was thinking about growing his hair longer.
This gained some controversy on Richardson's part due to the fact that other players on the team didn't meet these guidelines.
Dave Zirin, reporter for TheNation.com, even accused Richardson of racism.
Despite this, Newton agreed to Richardson's requests and was drafted first overall.
Newton would eventually start growing his hair out longer after Richardson sold the team to David Tepper..

He also became the only player to begin his career with consecutive 400-yard passing games and broke the Carolina Panthers franchise record of 547 yards previously held by Steve Beuerlein.
After Newton's second career game, Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers commented, "I think someone said in the locker room that I'm kind of glad we played him early in the season because when he figures it out fully, he's going to be even tougher to stop." Newton's three additional interceptions against the Packers tied him for the most interceptions thrown in the league.

The Panthers finished the season at 7–9.
Though this season could be seen by some as a "Sophomore Slump," he did improve in many statistical categories, improved on his efficiency, and cut back on his turnovers.
